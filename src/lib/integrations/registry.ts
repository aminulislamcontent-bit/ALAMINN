/**
 * Integration registry — verified external projects and how each one connects.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (honesty + licensing):
 *  - We do NOT vendor these repositories into this codebase. Many are GPL/AGPL,
 *    GB-scale, or native desktop/GPU projects (C/C++/Swift/Java/Python). Copying
 *    them in would break their licenses and this platform's build.
 *  - "adapter"  = we ship a real HTTP client + connection test against an official API.
 *  - "service"  = self-host the project, then connect it here via base URL + key.
 *  - "reference"= documentation / recipes / recipes to study, not a runtime dependency.
 *  - "desktop"  = runs on a workstation/GPU, not embeddable in this web server.
 *  - "unavailable" = the link did not resolve at verification time.
 *  - "excluded" = intentionally not integrated (offensive tooling / out of scope).
 *
 * Verification metadata (license/language/size) was read from the GitHub API.
